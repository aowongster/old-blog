I'll be blogging here to keep track of all things technical. For starters we can talk about how this blog was setup.

I forked the project https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now and renamed the repo to be aowongster.github.io. This will trigger github to automatically host this site on github pages.

To edit files, I edit in-line through github editor and commit directly to the project. Inside the `_posts` directory, you can create `.md` (markdown) files with the right header and file name conventions.

The blog itself is hosted on github pages and run through jekyll to render the markdown into html.

I'll be updating this page as I learn more.
